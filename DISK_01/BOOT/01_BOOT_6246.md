# Wait For Specified Amount Unless There's Been A Keypress

The amount to wait is specified in the accumulator. Note the wait time is not linear with the value of the accumulator but quadratic.

If there's been a keypress, we immediately return.

```
6246    2C 00 C0    BIT $C000
6249    30 0B       BMI $6256
```

Otherwise...

Set the carry bit and preserve the accumulator on the stack.

```
624B    38          SEC
624C    48          PHA
```

Keep reducing the accumulator by 1 until it's zero.

```
624D    E9 01       SBC #$01
624F    D0 FC       BNE $624D
```

Restore the preserved accumulator.

```
6251    68          PLA
```

Reduce the accumulator and loop back to preserve _that_ as the new accumulator we count down, until the new starting point hits zero.

```
6252    E9 01       SBC #$01
6254    D0 F6       BNE $624C
6256    60          RTS
```
