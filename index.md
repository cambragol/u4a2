# U4A2

An ongoing analysis and commentary of the disassembled code for Ultima IV on the Apple ][.

Files were extracted from disk images using [a2disk](https://github.com/jtauber/a2disk) and some of the code from [applepy](https://github.com/jtauber/applepy) was used to help with disassembly.

Start with [Disk 1](DISK_01).

## Change Log

* May 2020 — converted to Jekyll for publishing online
* April / May 2018 — started extraction and analysis
